# Cloudinary Component Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Cloudinary component with Convex for image upload, transformation, and management using **direct REST API calls** (no SDK dependencies!).

## Features Demonstrated

- **File Upload**: Two upload methods based on file size
  - **Base64 Upload**: Small files (< 5MB) through Convex
  - **Direct Upload**: Large files (>= 5MB) directly to Cloudinary
- **Image Display**: Show images with real-time transformations
- **Transformation Controls**: Adjust width, height, and crop settings
- **Asset Management**: Delete images from Cloudinary and database
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time progress tracking for direct uploads
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Direct API Calls**: No SDK dependencies, better performance and control
- **Secure**: Built-in signature generation for authenticated uploads

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in your credentials:

**Cloudinary Setup:**

1. Go to [Cloudinary Console](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Copy your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
4. Update `.env.local` with these values

**Convex Setup:**

1. Go to [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Copy your deployment URL
4. Update `.env.local` with the Convex deployment URL

### 3. Set Environment Variables in Convex

Set your Cloudinary credentials in Convex:

```bash
npx convex env set CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME your_cloud_name_here
npx convex env set CLOUDINARY_API_KEY your_api_key_here
npx convex env set CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET your_api_secret_here
```

### 4. Initialize Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

In a new terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing Upload Methods

The example app automatically chooses the upload method based on file size:

### Automatic Method Selection

- **Small files (< 5MB)**: Uses base64 upload through Convex
- **Large files (>= 5MB)**: Uses direct upload to Cloudinary

### Testing Different File Sizes

1. **Test Small File Upload (Base64)**:

   - Choose any image under 5MB
   - Upload will go through Convex backend
   - Progress shows "Processing base64 data..."

2. **Test Large File Upload (Direct)**:
   - Choose any image 5MB or larger
   - Upload goes directly to Cloudinary
   - Progress bar shows real-time upload progress

### Cloudinary Plan Limits

Be aware of your Cloudinary plan's file size limits when testing:

| Plan         | Max Image | Max Video |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| **Free**     | 10 MB     | 100 MB    |
| **Plus**     | 20 MB     | 2 GB      |
| **Advanced** | 40 MB     | 4 GB      |

> **Tip:** If uploads fail for large files, check that the file doesn't exceed your plan's limits. See [Cloudinary Pricing](https://cloudinary.com/pricing/compare-plans) for details.

### What You'll See

- **File size detection** in the UI
- **Upload method** displayed during upload
- **Progress tracking** for direct uploads
- **Success message** showing which method was used
- **Console logs** showing the upload flow

## Usage Examples

### Using React Hooks

```typescript
import { useQuery, useAction } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";
import { useCloudinaryUpload } from "@imaxis/cloudinary-convex/react";

function MyComponent() {
  // List images using Convex query
  const images = useQuery(api.cloudinary.listAssets, { limit: 20 });

  // Upload with progress tracking
  const { upload, isUploading, progress } = useCloudinaryUpload(
    api.cloudinary.upload
  );

  const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
    const result = await upload(file, { folder: "uploads" });
    console.log("Uploaded:", result);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={(e) => handleUpload(e.target.files![0])} />
      {isUploading && <p>Uploading... {progress}%</p>}
      {images?.map((img) => (
        <img key={img.publicId} src={img.secureUrl} alt="" />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server-side Operations

**Direct Component Usage (No SDK, No Wrappers)**

```typescript
import { action, query } from "./_generated/server";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// Upload with transformations
export const uploadImage = action({
  args: { base64Data: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Use component directly - no wrapper needed!
    return await ctx.runAction(components.cloudinary.lib.upload, {
      base64Data: args.base64Data,
      folder: "uploads",
      tags: ["user-content"],
      transformation: {
        width: 500,
        height: 500,
        crop: "fill",
        quality: "auto",
      },
    });
  },
});

// List assets
export const getImages = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.runQuery(components.cloudinary.lib.listAssets, {
      folder: "uploads",
      limit: 20,
      order: "desc",
    });
  },
});
```

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails with "credentials not found":**

- Check that environment variables are set in Convex
- Verify your Cloudinary credentials are correct

**Images don't load:**

- Check that the public_id is correct
- Verify your Cloudinary cloud name is set

**Component not found errors:**

- Run `npm run build` in the root directory
- Make sure you've run `npx convex dev` to generate types
